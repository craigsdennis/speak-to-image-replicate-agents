## Entry 5
### User said
```
When the microphone is one and being heard it would be great to show the front-end equalizer like view. Can you help add that?
```
### Summary
- Will add an animated equalizer/level meter to the voice streaming card so users can see live microphone input while recording.

## Entry 6
### User said
```
Equalizer doesn't seem to be moving
```
### Summary
- Reworked the audio level detection to capture RMS values and reset state so the visualization can respond to live input.

## Entry 7
### User said
```
I want it to move as I speak maybe more a wave form?
```
### Summary
- Replaced the bar visualization with an SVG waveform that plots the recent RMS history, yielding a more animated view of the microphone input.

## Entry 8
### User said
```
Great let's try and make that more wavey and take up more space, maybe with orange and yellows?
```
### Summary
- Updated the waveform to span the full card width, use an orange/yellow gradient, and sit flat when idle so mic activity feels more alive.

## Entry 9
### User said
```
Awesome that looks good. Let's write that to the truth window and commit
```
### Summary
- Logged the waveform refinements and will commit the updated UI plus Truth Window notes.
