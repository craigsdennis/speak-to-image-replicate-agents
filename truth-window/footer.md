# Truth Window: footer

## Entry 1
### User said
```
Okay I want to start a new truth-window log call it footer. I want to add a sticky footer to all pages that says "Built with 🧡 on Cloudflare Agent SDK && Replicate" On the second line write "👀 the code". Add links to agents.cloudflare.com, replicate.com, and https://github.com/craigsdennis/speak-to-image-replicate-agents.
```
### Summary
- Logged the new session and updated `PageShell` so every page now shows a sticky footer with the "Built with 🧡" message plus linked references to Agents, Replicate, and the GitHub repository.
