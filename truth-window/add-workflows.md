# Truth Window: add-workflows

## Entry 1
### User said
```
When displaying the edits, use imageFileName if it exists, and temporaryImageUrl
```
### Summary
- Update the image detail page so each edit (and the main preview) prefers the stored `imageFileName`, falling back to `temporaryImageUrl` when necessary.
