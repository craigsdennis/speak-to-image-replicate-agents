## Entry 1
### User said
```
Okay I'm starting a new truth-window session. This is called use-the-agent.md
```
### Summary
- Created this `truth-window/use-the-agent.md` log to capture subsequent requests verbatim along with summaries of my responses for the new session.

## Entry 2
### User said
```
Alright I'd love to see you break the App.tsx file into separate files. This is typically in a pages folder right?
```
### Summary
- Will reorganize the current single-file React app into separate components under a `src/pages/` directory, moving the create-image and detail routes (plus shared shell) out of `App.tsx`.
